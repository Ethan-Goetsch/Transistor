\section{Introduction} \label{section: introduction}

% In the introduction, the authors explain and establish the context of the study,
% and the reasons for undertaking it. The following questions should be answered:
% • What is the primary research question the authors are trying to answer?
% • Why is this question relevant for the scientific field?
% • What are the sub-questions the authors are trying to answer?
% Moreover, it is important to mention what has already been done (the state-
% of-the-art), in order to point out the limitations of the current approaches,
% and establish the starting point of your research (you should avoid reinventing
% the wheel). In this respect, also mention what are the main approaches or
% algorithms which have been proposed (also provide citations for those), and
% eventually, which among those you decided to focus on as a starting point for
% your research (motivating your choice).
% Next, briefly explain the main idea underlying the approach(es) you propose
% in your report in a non-technical way, and explicitly state what are the novelty
% factors, if any.
% Finally, briefly describe the structure of the report: what the reader can find
% in the different sections. This is important because of the multi-layer structure
% mentioned above.
