% \subsection{Greedy algorithm}
% The Greedy algorithm is a type of algorithm that makes the choice that looks the best at the moment. This algorithm is used because of its speed. However, this algorithm will not always yield the best outputs. This is because the algorithm does not do any backtracking, meaning that the Greedy algorithm must have an optimal start for a great end result. This means that the algorithm may target a path that seems logical at first but does not hold any potential in the future. Nonetheless, the Greedy algorithm may provide optimal solutions given the context of this paper.
